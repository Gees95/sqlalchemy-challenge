# SQLAlchemy Challenge: Climate Analysis and Exploration #

This project outlines the setup and execution of a climate analysis project focusing on Honolulu, Hawaii. The project utilizes Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and is structured into two main parts:

Climate Analysis and Data Exploration: This involves setting up a SQLite database, using SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) queries, and analyzing precipitation and station data. Steps include:

Setting up the database and reflecting tables into classes.
Performing queries to gather and analyze precipitation data and temperature observations from the most active station.
Visualizing the data through plots of precipitation over time and temperature histograms.
Climate App Design: Development of a Flask API based on the previous analysis. The API features several endpoints that provide JSON-formatted responses for precipitation data, station lists, and temperature observations. It also allows querying temperature statistics by date.
